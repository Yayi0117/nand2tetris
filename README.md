# Nand2Tetris

## Overview

Welcome to my Nand2Tetris project! This repository contains my implementation of the projects from the Nand2Tetris course. Nand2Tetris is a journey from basic logic gates to building a fully functional computer system, including a compiler, assembler, and operating system, all built from the ground up. You can learn more about the course [here](https://www.nand2tetris.org/course).

## Project Description

The Nand2Tetris course, also known as "The Elements of Computing Systems," provides a comprehensive and hands-on approach to understanding computer systems. The course is divided into two parts:
1. **Part I** focuses on building a basic computer from scratch using a hardware description language (HDL).
2. **Part II** covers the creation of a compiler, assembler, and operating system for the computer built in Part I.

## My Implementation With Python


### Part I: Hardware Construction

- **Project 1: Boolean Logic**
  - Implemented basic logic gates like AND, OR, and NOT.
- **Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic**
  - Built arithmetic logic unit (ALU) components, including adder and subtractor.
- **Project 3: Sequential Logic**
  - Developed memory components, such as flip-flops and registers.
- **Project 4: Machine Language**
  - Designed and tested the Hack machine language.
- **Project 5: Computer Architecture**
  - Assembled the Hack CPU and connected it with memory and input/output devices.
- **Project 6: Assembler**
  - Created an assembler to translate Hack assembly language into binary machine code.

### Part II: Software Construction

- **Project 7: Virtual Machine I**
  - Implemented the stack-based virtual machine.
- **Project 8: Virtual Machine II**
  - Extended the virtual machine to handle control and function calls.
- **Project 9: High-Level Language**
  - Write simple programs in the Jack programming language.
- **Project 10: Compiler I**
  - Built the syntax analyzer and parser.
- **Project 11: Compiler II**
  - Implemented the code generator.
- **Project 12: Operating System**
  - Designed the basic operating system, including the memory manager, string processing, and input/output handling.
  - Developed a simple game using the entire hardware and software stack I've built.
